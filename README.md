# 🚀 LeetCode Basic Questions (Striver A2Z)

Welcome to my **DSA practice repository** 👋  
This repo contains **basic programming problems** that I solved by following the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**, implemented in **my own approach using Python** 🐍.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong fundamentals** in logic, problem-solving, and coding basics before moving to advanced DSA topics.
