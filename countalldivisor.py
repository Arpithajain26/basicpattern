# # Divisors of a Number
# Easy

# Company
# You are given an integer n. You need to find all the divisors of n. Return all the divisors of n as an array or list in a sorted order.



# A number which completely divides another number is called it's divisor.


# Example 1

# Input: n = 6

# Output = [1, 2, 3, 6]

# Explanation: The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

# Example 2

# Input: n = 8

# Output: [1, 2, 4, 8]

# Explanation: The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.

num=int(input("enter the number "))
list1=[]
for i in range(1,num+1):
    if num%i==0:
        list1.append(i) 
print(list1)
