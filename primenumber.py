# Check for Prime Number
# Easy

# Company
# You are given an integer n. You need to check if the number is prime or not. Return true if it is a prime number, otherwise return false.



# A prime number is a number which has no divisors except 1 and itself.


# Example 1

# Input: n = 5

# Output: true

# Explanation: The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5 , So the number 5 is prime.

# Example 2

# Input: n = 8

# Output: false

# Explanation: The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8, thus it is not a prime number.


num=int(input("enter the number: "))
def isprime(num):
    for i in range(2,int(num**0.5)+1):
        if num%i==0:
            return False
    return True
n=isprime(num)
if n:
    print("it is prime number")
else:
    print("not a prime number")
